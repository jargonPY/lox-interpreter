### Static Scope

Lox uses **lexical scoping**. This means you can figure out which declaration a variable refers to just by reading the text of the program.

A _variable usage_ (variable expressions or assignments) refers to the _preceding_ (before in the program text) declaration with the same name in the innermost scope that encloses the expression where that variable is used.

- Since there is no mention of runtime behaviour, it implies that a variable expression _always refers to the same declaration through the entire execution of the program_.

```
var a = "global";

{
  fun showA() {
    print a;
  }

  showA();
  var a = "block";
  showA();
}
```

This program **never reassigns** any variable and contains only a single `print` statement. Yet, somehow, that `print` statement for a never-assigned variable prints two different values at **different points in time**.

### Scope and Mutable Environments

But in our implementation, environments do act like the entire block is one scope, just a scope that changes over time. Closures do not like that. When a function is declared, it captures a reference to the current environment. The function should capture a frozen snapshot of the environment as it existed at the moment the function was declared. But instead, in the Java code, it has a reference to the actual mutable environment object. When a variable is later declared in the scope that environment corresponds to, the closure sees the new variable, even though the declaration does not precede the function.

### Semantic Analysis

### Challenges

1. Why is it safe to eagerly define the variable bound to a functionâ€™s name when other variables must wait until after they are initialized before they can be used?

Because the name of a function can't be self referential. A variable can be initialized with any expression, where as a function name is always initialized / bound to a block statement.

```
var a = 10;
{
  var a = a;
}

vs.

fun a() {

}
```

2. How do other languages you know handle local variables that refer to the same name in their initializer, like:

```
var a = "outer";
{
  var a = a;
}
```

Is it a runtime error? Compile error? Allowed? Do they treat global variables differently? Do you agree with their choices? Justify your answer.
